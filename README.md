# EXEPlatformID
EXE Platform Identifier

This tool will attempt to identify what OS platform the selected executable requires.
I'm developing this tool in the hopes someonne will find it useful.

Parts of EXEPlatformID is based on source code provided by answer on StackOverflow

Because of this, I do own nor will I claim to own the code provided bby said answer code.
